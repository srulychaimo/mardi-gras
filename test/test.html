          Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival
          celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of the
          Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash
          Wednesday, which is known as Shrove Tuesday. Mardi Gras is French for
          "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating
          rich, fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of
          the Lenten season.

          Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations
          before the fasting and religious obligations associated with the
          penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom,
          Mardi Gras is more usually known as Pancake Day or (traditionally)
          Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word shrive, meaning "to administer
          the sacrament of confession to; to absolve").
