            Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival
            celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of the
            Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash
            Wednesday, which is known as Shrove Tuesday. Mardi Gras is French
            for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of
            eating rich, fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices and
            fasting of the Lenten season.

            Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide
            celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations associated
            with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United
            Kingdom, Mardi Gras is more usually known as Pancake Day or
            (traditionally) Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word shrive,
            meaning "to administer the sacrament of confession to; to absolve").

            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
            including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for
            about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before
            Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
            tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
            most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season.
